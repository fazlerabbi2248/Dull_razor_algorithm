# Dull Razor Algorithm for Hair Removal

The Dull Razor Algorithm is a technique used for hair removal in images. It involves several steps to identify and remove hair from an image. Below is a detailed explanation of each step involved in the process:

## 1. Convert Image to Grayscale

The input image is initially converted from the RGB color space to grayscale. Grayscale images contain only the intensity information of each pixel, simplifying further processing. This conversion is achieved using the `cv2.cvtColor()` function.

## 2. Apply Blackhat Morphological Operation

The blackhat operation is a morphological operation that highlights dark structures on a light background. Here's the process involved:

- Creation of a structuring element (kernel) with an elliptical shape and a size of (5, 5) using `cv2.getStructuringElement()`.
- Application of the blackhat operation to the grayscale image using the created kernel via `cv2.morphologyEx()`. This operation enhances fine details, such as hair, by subtracting the morphological closing of the image from the original.

## 3. Apply Thresholding

Thresholding is then applied to the blackhat image to obtain a binary hair mask. The process involves:

- Use of the `cv2.threshold()` function to convert the grayscale image to a binary image based on a specified threshold value. Pixels with intensity values greater than the threshold become white (255), indicating potential hair pixels, while the rest become black (0).

## 4. Perform Inpainting

Inpainting is a technique used to fill in missing or damaged parts of an image. Here's how it's applied for hair removal:

- Utilization of the `cv2.inpaint()` function, taking the original input image and the obtained hair mask as inputs.
- Implementation of the `cv2.INPAINT_TELEA` method, a fast, edge-aware inpainting algorithm based on the Navier-Stokes equation. This process replaces identified hair pixels with plausible texture information based on surrounding pixels, effectively removing the hair from the image.
